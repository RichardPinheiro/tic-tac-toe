## 🧠 Project Overview

This AI is designed for a **deterministic**, **perfect-information**, **zero-sum** game environment — exactly the kind of scenario foundational to many classic AI problems.

> ⚠️ It will either win or draw — **never lose.**

This project puts into practice key AI principles that scale to more complex problems like:

- Chess and Go engines
- Real-time strategy AI
- Tactical planning agents
- Search-based decision systems

## 🧠 How the AI Model Works

This project implements a **search-based AI reasoning model** using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI evaluates every possible future board state recursively, reasoning through the game tree to make an optimal decision at every turn.

Rather than using hardcoded rules or heuristics, this AI:
- Simulates future outcomes for each possible move
- Assigns utility values to terminal states (`1` win, `-1` loss, `0` draw)
- Propagates scores backward through the tree
- Chooses the move that maximizes or minimizes utility, depending on the current player

This structure reflects how early AI systems approached complex decision-making problems before learning-based systems became dominant.

### ✨ Model Architecture

Internally, the model uses:
- A **public interface** (`minimax`) to return the optimal move
- A **private recursive engine** (`_minimax_internal`) that evaluates both score and action
- Separate functions for the **maximizing** and **minimizing** player decisions
- Pure functions (no mutation), ensuring every recursion is safe and predictable

This mirrors architectures used in:
- Turn-based tactical games
- Board game engines (chess, checkers)
- Symbolic planning systems
- Automated decision pipelines

> 🧠 The AI does not "react" — it **reasons**.
